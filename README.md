# SQUAD

SQUAD is an adaptive application that is going to be developed for training purposes to explore the field of adaptive applications.

Adaptive applications are able to learn from user interactions, and use this information to provide more personalized and relevant experiences. They often incorporate machine learning algorithms and other advanced technologies to make predictions about user behavior and adapt to new situations.

A few statistics retrieved from League Of Legends API will be integrated with personality traits in order to model users and to suggest a list of the best suitable users to play with based on machine learning prediction upon both LOL info (such as ELO) and personalities.
